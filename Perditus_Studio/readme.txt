Originally Studio J, which we made the game together-ish related to the GGJ2021 repository.

This is a folder for all the games that my team worked on for Perditus Studios. 

The only game in fact.

We worked on the idea of the game together under this name, but in the end, I created the small game "Untitled Game" (made with Bitsy) for Waffle Games 2021.

As for collaboration, we all didn't have a good schedule to work extensively, besides other life events that went on.

Who knows if as Perditus Studios, we will make any more games or not. Perhaps as another one.

>>untitled game 6 is the most recent version of untitled game, and one that was presented in Waffle Games. It is hosted on my itch.io page.
